#
# This script is invoked from the Jenkins builds to build Kudu
# and run all the unit tests.
#
# Environment variables may be used to customize operation:
#   BUILD_TYPE: Default: DEBUG
#     Maybe be one of ASAN|TSAN|DEBUG|RELEASE|COVERAGE|LINT|IWYU|TIDY
#
#   KUDU_ALLOW_SLOW_TESTS   Default: 1
#     Runs the "slow" version of the unit tests. Set to 0 to
#     run the tests more quickly.
#
#   TEST_TMPDIR   Default: /tmp/kudutest-$UID
#     Specifies the temporary directory where tests should write their
#     data. It is expected that following the completion of all tests, this
#     directory is empty (i.e. every test cleaned up after itself).
#
#   RUN_FLAKY_ONLY    Default: 0
#     Only runs tests which have failed recently, if this is 1.
#     Used by the kudu-flaky-tests jenkins build.
#
#   KUDU_FLAKY_TEST_ATTEMPTS  Default: 1
#     If more than 1, will fetch the list of known flaky tests
#     from the kudu-test jenkins job, and allow those tests to
#     be flaky in this build.
#
#   TEST_RESULT_SERVER  Default: none
#     The host:port pair of a server running test_result_server.py.
#     This must be configured for flaky test resistance or test result
#     reporting to work.
#
#   ENABLE_DIST_TEST  Default: 0
#     If set to 1, will submit C++ and Java tests to be run by the
#     distributed test runner instead of running them locally.
#     This requires that $DIST_TEST_HOME be set to a working dist_test
#     checkout (and that dist_test itself be appropriately configured to
#     point to a cluster)
#
#   BUILD_JAVA        Default: 1
#     Build and test java code if this is set to 1.
#
#   BUILD_PYTHON       Default: 1
#     Build and test the Python wrapper of the client API.
#
#   BUILD_PYTHON3      Default: 1
#     Build and test the Python wrapper of the client API in Python. This
#     option is not mutually exclusive from BUILD_PYTHON. If both options
#     are set (default), then both will be run.
#
#   PIP_FLAGS  Default: ""
#     Extra flags which are passed to 'pip' when setting up the build
#     environment for the Python wrapper.
#
#   PIP_INSTALL_FLAGS  Default: ""
#     Extra flags which are passed to 'pip install' when setting up the build
#     environment for the Python wrapper. Python arguments are
#     context-dependent so sadly we can't reuse PIP_FLAGS here.
#
#   GRADLE_FLAGS       Default: ""
#     Extra flags which are passed to 'gradle' when running Gradle commands.
#
#   ERROR_ON_TEST_FAILURE    Default: 1
#     Whether test failures will cause this script to return an error.
#
#   KUDU_REPORT_TEST_RESULTS Default: 0
#     If non-zero, tests are reported to the central test server.

# If a commit messages contains a line that says 'DONT_BUILD', exit
# immediately.
