License information for Kudu third-party dependencies
==========================================================

This directory contains scripts which download and install several third-party
dependencies of Kudu. In production builds of Kudu, most of these dependencies
are statically linked into the Kudu binaries, while in the Kudu binary test
jar, some of these libraries are distributed as dynamically-linked shared
objects. A few of these dependencies are used only at build time and are noted
as such.
